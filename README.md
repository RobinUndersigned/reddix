# Reddix
Reddix is a basic reddit clone. I'm building this in order to improve my React, Express and Typescript skills.

## Frontend
In the frontend I'm using React (TS) with Tailwind 3 and Chakra UI.

## Backend
For the backend API I'm using Expressjs (TS) and Postgres as a Database. I also added Prisma.io for ORM.
